## @bracketed/typescript-config

Just a simple TypeScript config that you can use in your projects.
This has been created to solve some of the issues that I have with the default TypeScript config, and to have a cool little package I can use in my projects and show off to my friends lol.

It also has some actual updates too, im making sure I keep this up to date since like, I use it in my projects and you too so I need to make sure it works and is up to date.
